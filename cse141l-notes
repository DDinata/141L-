programs:
p1 - multiplicative inverse
input: 16-bit unsigned integer (address 8-9)
input format is: |2^15|..|2^0|
output: 16-bit fractional result (address 10-11)
output format is: |2^0|..|2^-15|

p2 - division
input: 16-bit unsigned integer numerator (address 0-1), 8-bit unsigned integer divisor (address 2)
output: 16-bit unsigned integer quotient + 8-bit unsigned quotient fraction (address 4-6)
output format is: |2^15|..|2^-8|

p3 - square root
input: 16-bit unsigned integer (address 16-17)
input format is: |2^15|..|2^0|
output: 8-bit result (address 18) ROUNDED
ouput format is: |2^7|..|2^0|   THIS IS ROUNDED (up at 0.5)
